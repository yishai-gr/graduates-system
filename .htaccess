RewriteEngine On

# 1. Block any request that does NOT start with /api
# This protects the source code, frontend files, and everything else in the repo
# from being accessed directly via the Hostinger server.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api
RewriteRule ^ - [F]

# 2. Redirect /api requests to the backend entry point
# This assumes the backend/public/index.php handles routing based on $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
RewriteRule ^api/ backend/public/index.php [L,QSA]
